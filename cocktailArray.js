[{"NEW GARBAGE CAN, and wash it out thoroughly!!!!! (Preferably the
[{"big ones 40-55gal). First Pour in all of the Grain (10 bottles of
[{"1.75ml [Handle]), keep in mind that this recipie is for a Large
[{"Party, not 10 people sitting around getting loaded.....Anyway, next
[{"add the dry packets of mix. We used to get the largest industrial
[{"bags we could, don't go for quality, you're not going to remember
[{"anyway. Now this is the most critical part, the fruit. This is why
[{"I put this on here...any joker can make punch, but I figured I
[{"would distibute my years of fruit research for free....the Best
[{"friends you have in the Fruit community are the Orange and the
[{"Apple. This is because they absorb the grain better than anything
[{"else I tested. So make sure you get some of these in every glass
[{"you get, and eat them, DON'T EVER THROW THESE OUT, this is the best
[{"part of the drink. Bananas suck, they get gushy, watermellon works
[{"ok but the seeds get to be a pain in the ass when you can't see so
[{"well, pineapple is good, basically you get the point. Cut the fruit
[{"into wedges and throw it in the mix and let it sit around for a
[{"minute...Now throw in the bags of ice and fill it up to desired
[{"potency with water, mixing can be done with a canoe paddle or a 2x4
[{"or anything else you've got lying around...a disposable camera is
